### BREAKING CHANGES

* The application has been completely redesigned from a simple 'Hello, World!' example to a full AI-powered terminal chat assistant.
Users must now obtain a Google Gemini API key and set it as the GEMINI_API_KEY environment variable before running the application.
The installation steps and usage paradigm have fundamentally changed. Refer to the updated README.md for new setup and build instructions, as well as usage documentation and keybindings.
